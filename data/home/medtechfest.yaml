      The two-day Science Festival serves as a platform for critical discussions on 
      ethical and other issues surrounding the use of AI in healthcare. 
      Academics, medical professionals, and tool developers discuss the opportunities
      and present challenges linked with the integration of AI tools into clinical practice across various medical fields. 
      Festival visitors will get the chance to discuss with the experts directly in open roundtable sessions. In our 
      MedTechFactory, they may experience how AI recommendations are generated and used for diagnostic and
      treatment purposes.
